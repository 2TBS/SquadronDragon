# SquadronDragon

### Lore
You are the last surviving member of the Dragon Squadron, 
a group of interstellar revolutionaries that has been ruthlessly pursued out in the hollow reaches of outer space by their former masters,
the imperious organization known as the Eclipse Conclave. 
There is little hope left for the liberation of humanity,
as the universe begins to fall under the Conclaveâ€™s control with the increasing presence of B.L.A.D.E. 
(Battlefront Legionnaire Automatic D.R.A.G.O.N. Eradicator) warships. 
Your directive is to outfit your D.R.A.G.O.N. (Direlight Revolutionary Aeronautic Gunship Ordnance Neutralizer) 
with the armaments necessary to shoot and scatter any resistance in your path, 
while protecting the secrets that will spark a revolution.

### Gameplay

Every few seconds, new enemy ships will appear! It is your duty to shoot them down before they shoot you down. 
You have unlimited ammunition, but when your hull strength reaches zero, the game is over! Try to get the highest
score by shooting down the most ships before dying.
